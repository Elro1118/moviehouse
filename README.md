# Movie House
Our goal for this project was to build a movie website using our knowledge about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">Html</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS3</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a> and working as a team. This is the link for the movie website: https://moviehouse-elro1118.netlify.com/ I hope you enjoy this website!

I am very proud of this project because my colleagues and I work as a team to achieve our goal. In addition, we strengthen our connection as colleagues and friends.
